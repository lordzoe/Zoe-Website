<p>
    This Fall, I had the priviledge of attending both the International Joint Conference for Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) and the Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering Conference (CSChE) at the Palais des Congrès de Montréal.<br><br>

    I am very proud to have presented my doctoral research among the engineering community, titled: <i>Multimodal Classification of Cognitive Load in Virtual Reality Environments for Chemical Engineering Education</i>, which was delivered in the Education in Chemical Engineering technical session.
