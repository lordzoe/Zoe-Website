    It is a privilege to have co-founded the Gravitas Research Corps, a not-for-profit organization, with such a remarkable team.<br><br>
    
    Diallo, Jon, Vlad, and I first met at the International Institute of Astronautical Sciences (IIAS) in 2023.

    Following the completion of our IIAS training, our connection grew even stronger and stayed in touch on a regular basis. 
    
    Our shared passion for space research eventually led us to evolve into the Gravitas Research Corps. 

    We are dedicated to conducting high-impact studies that contribute to the growing body of knowledge supporting future space exploration, particularly Lunar and Martian evinronments. 

    Our first mission is set for June 2025 at the Integrated Lunar and Martian Analog Habitat (ILMAH) at the University of North Dakota.<br><br>

    We have many exciting research projects lined up, spanning from space medicine and AI integrated systems to space systems operations.

    Beyond research, we are looking forward to engaging the public with our outreach programs and educational initiatives! More to come soon.<br><br>
