    It was a pleasure attending the North, Central American and Carribean Space Generation Workshop (NCAC-SGW) hosted by the Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC) and the Canadian Space Agency.

    During the event, I had the opportunity to participate in the Inspiration and Education (The Future of Space) working group, where we discussed the importance of space education and outreach programs in inspiring the next generation of space professionals.<br><br>

    I was also honored to be a recipient of the Space Leader Award for my significant contributions to the space community across the North and Central America and the Carribean regions.
