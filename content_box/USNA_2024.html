    I am deeply humbled to have been invited to the United States Naval Academy (USNA) and present a talk to their Aerospace Engineering students about the power of interdisciplinary research, my perspective on success, and the skill set it takes to get there.<br><br>

    It was refreshing observe the midshipmen's curiosity, engagement, and thought-provoking questions throughout my visit. 
    
    They are undoubtedly bright minds who will shape the future.<br><br>

    Thank you, USNA, for the warm welcome and hospitality. I look forward to seeing the incredible contributions these students will bring to their field!
