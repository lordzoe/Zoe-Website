    Currently in my PhD at Queen's University, I am researching how students learn Chemistry in virtual reality (VR). I am particularly interested in cognitive load, which is the amount of working memory a person uses while performing a task.
    
    My goal is to use machine learning algorithms to predict cognitive load by using fNIRS wearables to monitor hemodynamics in the brain, as well as visual attention through eye-tracking technologies.<br><br> 
    
    From there, I aspire to propose guidelines to further prevent cognitive overload (i.e., being overwhelmed) as students use VR devices to learn difficult Chemistry concepts.<br><br>
