    Excited to be at the Gravity Offset Laboratory at the Florida Institute of Technology this week!

    Their facility is equipped with an electromechanical system that mimics reduced gravity conditions and can be dynamically adjusted in real-time for a precise analog of lunar, Martian, and zero-gravity environments.<br><br> 
    
    During my visit, I will be conducting my research on biomonitoring EVA systems to study physiological and ergonomic responses in simulated lunar conditions.
