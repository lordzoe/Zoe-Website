    Kicking off the weekend with creativity and technology, the Hackathon brought together by Ingenuity Labs Research Institute, Connected Minds CFREF, and Experience Ventures on February 8th-11th 2024. 
    
    This year's event challenged its participants to design innovative solutions that focused on enhancing professional skills and competencies in real-world healthcare scenarios. 
    
    Participants were encouraged to explore unique approaches, technologies, and methodologies to design a product that addresses the challenges faced by healthcare professionals in leadership roles and task-oriented environments. 
    
    The hackathon's outcome was remarkably impressive, with 21 teams presenting their projects that aim to redefine the landscape of medical education and training.<br><br>
 
    The winning 'Med Vue' project, introduced by Akshay Laxman Desale, Brian Pereira, and Imogen Lawford-Wickman, was engineered as a two-tiered system to quantitatively evaluate stress levels and anxiety experienced by surgeons, offering a significant advancement in the training of simulated surgical procedures.<br><br>
 
    “Stage 1 involves the real-time monitoring of a surgeon's physiological markers, including heart rate variability and skin conductance, through advanced wearable technologies,” Desale explains. 
    
    “Stage 2 introduces an innovative application of computer vision and machine learning algorithms to track the surgeon's hand movements and eye patterns meticulously.”<br><br>
 
    Desale highlighted their excitement of project, noting, “Following the successful presentation and the positive reception of Med Vue, we are eager to propel our project into its next phase of development.”
 
    Siobhan Lee, Spencer Osborn, Coleman Farvolden, and Ryan McGillivray showcased their winning project 'NeuroNeck', a novel approach to training for the mobilization of spinal injuries. 
    
    Through the use of sensors and algorithms, NeuroNeck provides instant feedback on the precision of neck and head movements with the aim of assisting emergency first responders and healthcare professionals. 
    
    The device's use of LEDs and gyroscopes to signal movement with remarkable accuracy marks a significant development in medical simulation.<br><br>
 
    Lee highlighted the project's uniqueness, saying, "We were determined to create a device that filled an unmet need in the market. 
    
    By focusing on a less explored aspect of medical simulation, we were able to distinguish our project from others, contributing a novel solution to the field."<br><br>
 
    The success of the event underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration across students of all disciplines at Queen’s University and St. Lawrence College in utilizing the potential of technology to transform healthcare education. 
    
    Through the collaboration of Ingenuity Labs, Connected Minds, and Experience Ventures, these partnerships once again paved the way for innovation in the medical field.<br><br>
