<p>
    This year at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Milan, I am very proud to be presenting my researching findings on two of my space medicine studies.<br><br>

    The first titled: *Ergonomic Evaluation of Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems on Musculoskeletal Strain and Fatigue during Extended Lunar Surface EVAs* was presented in the Life Support, Habitats, and EVA Systems Technical Session. 
    
    The second titled: *The Pursuit for a “Gold Standard” Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Method for Human Spaceflight: A Novel CPR Testing Platform*, was presented in the Medical CAre for Humans in Space Technical Session.<br><br>
    
    I was also honored to be a recipient of the CSA grant award and selected as one of CSA’s International Space Education Board (ISEB) students to attend the IAC 2024, alongside students supported by JAXA, ESA, NASA, and other ISEB member space agencies.
