<p>
    It is with great pleasure that I will be working as a Research Assistant at the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Fluid Dynamics (LCFD) at Concordia University!<br><br>

    I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity, as this is a big milestone toward building my profession in the space medicine field. 
    
    This summer, I will be engineering a new class of CPR manikins for space applications using 3D-printed technologies and cardiovascular mechanics.
