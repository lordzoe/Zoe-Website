    As my first time volunteering at Science Rendezvous, I am happy to be supporting my peer researchers in the Chemical Engineering Graduate Student Association (CEGSA) at Queenâ€™s University to showcase a pharmaceutical plant tour/simulation in virtual reality (VR). 
    
    For many of the kids and their families, this was their first time experiencing VR. 
    
    I was also very excited to be cheering on my colleagues in the Chemsitry Department for their spectacular Chemistry Magic Show!
