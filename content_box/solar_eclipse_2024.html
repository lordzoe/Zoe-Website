    In this eye-opening event, I had to oppertunity to serve as a Total Solar Eclipse Ambassador for Queen's University, where I engaged with the University community and the public to promote awareness and understanding of the solar eclipse. 
    
    I collaborated with faculty and student groups to coordinate viewing events and ensure safe eclipse-watching practices, provided informative materials, and facilitated discussions to increase public interest in astronomy and space science. 
    
    Hopefully my passion for astronomy and commmitment to public science education inspired others to appreciate the beauty of the cosmos!
