    I am happy to share that I completed my CHEM 419 independent study (research project) in Dr. Majewski's Solar Energy Conversion Group, where I examined the stabilization of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I) under ambient conditions through the presence of lecithin capping groups.<br><br>
    
    Microwave-assisted solvothermal methods were experimented to replace conventional hot-injection methods that require harsh reaction conditions and high energetic demands. 
    
    Promising nanocrystals were further isolated and characterized by X-Ray Powder Diffraction, alongside UV/VIS, Photoluminescence, and ATR-IR Spectroscopic techniques.<br><br>
    
    Thus, my research project aspired to optimize the existing synthesis of cesium lead halide nanocrystals in order to enhance its stability under ambient conditions while supporting a greener and more sustainable approach.
